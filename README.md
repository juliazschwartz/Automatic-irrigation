# Automatic-irrigation
system for automatic irrigation programmed in C, using Arduino, based on the soil moisture level. A hose was attached to the pump to irrigate up to 15 potted plants. The script ensures that the humidity is checked every certain period of time, and then it is decided whether the pump is activated or not.
